Google Drive Copy Folder
===========

This is a Google Drive Web app hosted at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-folder/kfbicpdhiofpicipfggljdhjokjblnhl). 
This app will recursively copy all contents and sub-folders within a Google Drive folder.  As long as you have viewing rights on a folder, you can copy it in its entirety to your own Google Drive.  The folder will be placed in your Google Drive, and you can move it from there.

## Usage 

1. Open Google Drive
2. Right-click on the folder you wish to copy
3. Select "Get Link"
4. Press "CTRL-C" to copy the link
5. In the app press "CTRL-V" to paste the folder URL
6. Choose a name, and press copy.  Leave the window open until complete.

In addition, the app user will become the owner of the new folder and all sub-folders and contents.  This makes it especially handy for making a new copy of shared information when someone leaves an organization.

## Notes 

* This app does not currently work in browsers other than Chrome or Chromium.
* If you use the "Copy Sharing Permissions" option, please note that it will send **several** emails to each owner, editor and viewer.
* This app requires several permissions.  The permissions to access your Documents and Spreadsheets, as well as know your identity and email address, are all related to the Copy Permissions option.  If you do not select this option, this app will not read your identity and it will only interact with your Drive by copying files, not by identifying sharing permissions.  You can view the source code on the Github page, listed below.
