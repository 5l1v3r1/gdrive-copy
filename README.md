Google Drive Copy Folder
===========

This is a Google Drive Web app hosted at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-folder/kfbicpdhiofpicipfggljdhjokjblnhl). 
This app will recursively copy all contents and sub-folders within a Google Drive folder.  As long as you have viewing rights on a folder, you can copy it in its entirety to your own Google Drive.  The folder will be placed in your Google Drive, and you can move it from there.

To launch app: click "Visit Website" button at top of window in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-folder/kfbicpdhiofpicipfggljdhjokjblnhl).

## Usage 

1. Select your folder with the Google Picker, or paste a folder URL with Ctrl-C
2. Choose a name for the new folder
3. Click "Copy Folder".  When the copy begins, you will be alerted that you can close the window.

In addition, the app user will become the owner of the new folder and all sub-folders and contents.  This makes it especially handy for making a new copy of shared information when someone leaves an organization.

## Privacy

This app does not expose your files in any way.  The copying takes place exclusively through Google Drive, meaning that no one except the user running the app will have access to the copied files.  The only exception to this is if a user copies sharing permissions, in which case collaborators will be able to see the new files just like before.

## Notes 

* This app performs best in Google Chrome or Chromium.
* This app requires several permissions to run.  The app needs to run offline so that you can close the window while the copying completes.  You can view the source code on the Github page, listed below, to review the app and launch your own copy of the app if security is a concern.
* If you'd like to copy sharing permissions from the original folder, select "Yes" for Copy Sharing Permissions
* By default the folder will copy to the same location as the original folder.  You can copy it to the root directory by selecting "Root directory" under "Copy folder to"
