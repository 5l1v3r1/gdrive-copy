Copy Folder
===========

This is a Google Drive Web app hosted at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-folder/kfbicpdhiofpicipfggljdhjokjblnhl)
This app will recursively copy all contents and sub-folders within a Google Drive folder.  As long as you have viewing rights on a folder, you can copy it in its entirety to your own Google Drive.  The folder will be placed in your Google Drive, and you can move it from there.

## Usage 

1. Open Google Drive
2. Right-click on the folder you wish to copy
3. Select "Get Link"
4. Press "CTRL-C" to copy the link
5. In the app press "CTRL-V" to paste the folder URL
6. Choose a name, and press copy.  Leave the window open until complete.

In addition, the app user will become the owner of the new folder and all sub-folders and contents.  This makes it especially handy for making a new copy of shared information when someone leaves an organization.

## Disclaimers
